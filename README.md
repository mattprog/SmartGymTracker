# SmartGymTracker

This is a group project for CEN4090L.

Smart Gym Tracker is a web-based fitness tracking application that lets users log workouts, record biometric data, track milestones, and view trends. Smart Gym Tracker utilizes a React + Tailwind CSS frontend, C# backend, and a MySQL database to create a simple but powerful gym tracker app that allows users to simply enter their workout data and see trends.
